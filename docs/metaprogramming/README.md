These are some incomplete notes / tutorial on metaprogramming.

Here are a set of other references for Learning about metaprogramming that you may want to read.

- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/) is a book about how to prove theorems in Lean 4. It does not describe how to do metaprogramming yourself but it is preliminary material that is needed to start metaprogramming.
- [The Lean 4 Manual](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc) which is currently incomplete but which should
  become the definitive guide to the Lean 4 system, including metaprogramming.
- [The Lean 4 sourcecode](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/tree/master/src) is currently not well documented but there are some good docstrings in there.
